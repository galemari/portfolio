                <p class="text">I'm Mariana, born in Venezuela, and I'm currently working as an English teacher for Spanish-speaking students. I've been studying programming in various bootcamps such as ADA from Argentina, Coding Dojo from the USA, and Talento Digital from Chile.
    
                    My experience as a junior developer has been brief,
                    mainly involving personal projects, but I'm actively
                    seeking collaborations with other programmers.
                    You should contact me if you want an easy-going
                    and detail-oriented worker. You can find my social
                    media profiles left side corner.</p>

                    Hi! I'm Mariana López, a fullstack JavaScript developer. Although I don't have industry experience yet,
                    I'm highly motivated to learn and improve in this field. In addition to my interest in technology,
                    I'm an English teacher, which helps me communicate well in this language and collaborate with international teams.
                    You can contact me on Instagram @maryl.teacher or on LinkedIn as Mariana López Carpiob. I'm looking for opportunities
                    to learn and grow in the tech world.
