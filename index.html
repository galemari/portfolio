        I'm Mariana, born in Venezuela, and I'm currently working as an English
        teacher for Spanish-speaking students. I've been studying programming in
        various bootcamps such as ADA from Argentina, Coding Dojo from the USA,
        and Talento Digital from Chile. My experience as a junior developer has
        been brief, mainly involving personal projects, but I'm actively seeking
        collaborations with other programmers. You should contact me if you want
        an easy-going and detail-oriented worker. You can find my social media
        profiles left side corner.

        Hi! I'm Mariana López, a fullstack JavaScript developer. 
        
        Although I don't have industry experience yet, I'm highly motivated to learn and
        improve in this field. In addition to my interest in technology, I'm an
        English teacher, which helps me communicate well in this language and
        collaborate with international teams. You can contact me on Instagram
        @maryl.teacher or on LinkedIn as Mariana López Carpiob. I'm looking for
        opportunities to learn and grow in the tech world.
